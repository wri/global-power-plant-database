# Contributing to the Global Power Plant Database

Contributions to the Global Power Plant Database (GPPD) are highly encouraged!


#### Quickstart
There are four simple ways to contribute to GPPD.
  * Correcting or adding data for existing fields: file an issue on GitHub using the [data submission template](https://github.com/WRI/global-power-plant-database/issues/new?template=data_submission_template.md).
  * Suggesting new fields not currently in the database: file an issue on GitHub using the [database enhancement template](https://github.com/WRI/global-power-plant-database/issues/new?template=database_enhancement_template.md).
  * Contributing to the codebase: file an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/WRI/global-power-plant-database/issues/new).
  * Using GPPD in your research: consider [emailing us](mailto:powerexplorer@wri.org); we would love to talk about your research and opportunities for collaboration


## Things to know before getting started

### GPPD is an open-source open-access database
The sole existence of Global Power Plant Database is to be __open__.
That means the data points that populate the dataset need to come from other open sources or be original to GPPD.
Proprietary, commercial, and subscription-based datasets might contain highly desired information, but their inclusion into GPPD (particularly _en masse_) is not always possible.
__Please refrain from suggesting data corrections or data contributions from non-shareable data sources.__
If you are the creator of such a closed dataset and would like to extend a suitable license to GPPD, please contact us via [email](mailto:powerexplorer@wri.org).

### We are still working on GPPD
GPPD is in active development.
The latest release of the database has advanced our goal of taking inventory of all global power generating facilities, but there is still more work to be done.
Our development roadmap includes:
  * improving generation estimation methodology
  * adding plant attributes such as water use, annual emissions (CO2, NOx, SOx, PM, ...), emission control technology, amd more granular fuel types
  * adding more plants in countries and regions where our coverage is weak
  * improving ability to handle and separate generating units that are part of a larger power plant
  * software infrastructure improvements

While we value suggestions and contributions from the public, please search the GitHub Issues for relevant suggestions before creating a duplicate issue/topic.


## I am ready to contribute

GPPD uses GitHub issues to track contributions.
Please use a clear and descriptive title for an issue you open, as that will be used to identify the suggestion.


### Reporting inaccurate data

Data corrections can be reported using the [data submission template](https://github.com/WRI/global-power-plant-database/issues/new?template=data_submission_template.md).
Please fill out the template to the best of your ability so we can quickly understand the scope and severity of the proposed correction(s).
Remember that the data you propose to include into GPPD needs to be shareable and meet a standard of source quality.
At this time we will likely reject unattributable correction proposals that are close to "I know Plant X runs on Fuel A not Fuel B", _except when the correction concerns the plant geolocation_.
If you are a plant operator, hold some official position, or are a data curator yourself and want to contribute corrections, __please do create an issue or contact us by email__.


### Contributing new data

New data contributions or data sources can be brought to our attention using the [data submission template](https://github.com/WRI/global-power-plant-database/issues/new?template=data_submission_template.md).
Please fill out the template to the best of your ability so we can quickly weigh the time-value trade off to getting that data included into GPPD.


### Suggesting enhancements

Enhancements and expansions of GPPD such as new database fields can be proposed using the [database enhancement template](https://github.com/WRI/global-power-plant-database/issues/new?template=database_enhancement_template.md).
Please search the GitHub issues (including closed issues) to view existing proposals and consider posting your thoughts in the comment thread if the issue has not been closed already.
